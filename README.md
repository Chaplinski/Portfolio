**Letter of Recommendation**

I have contained in this repository 2 letters of recommendation from my former employers at KAABOO Del Mar, San Diego's second largest event. I was given the task of handling group sales.All goals were met, as the event sold out passes in August. This was a one-season contract which I fulfilled beyond expectations.


**MoveBall** 

This is the result of following introductory instructions on building a game engine in Java. I have edited parts of the code to change the direction of the ball and the window size.


**Jazzhands**

This is a variant of the popular game FizzBuzz where I inserted line breaks, changed the variable names to "Jazz" and "Hands", and changed the values from 5 and 7 to 3 and 5.

**Resume**

I have also included a PDF of my resume.
