From March 2016 until September 2016 I was given the task of handling group sales for San Diego's second largest event - KAABOO Del Mar. All goals were met, as the event sold out passes in August. This was a one-season contract which I fulfilled beyond expectations.

Chris Racan, Senior VP of Business Development, was my direct supervisor. Chris is best reached via e-mail.

Shawnna Earnest, Senior VP of HR, hired me and supervised the department's day to day activities. Shawnna is best reached via phone or e-mail.
